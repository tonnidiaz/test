When choosing a base coin for triangular arbitrage trading, you should consider factors such as liquidity, trading volume, volatility, and the presence of significant price discrepancies. Here's a brief overview of each coin you mentioned to help you decide:

### 1. **FLOKI (Floki Inu):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** FLOKI is a meme coin, and while it has gained popularity, its trading volume and liquidity can be highly variable depending on market sentiment.
   - **Volatility:** FLOKI is typically more volatile, which could lead to larger price discrepancies but also increases the risk of slippage and execution issues.

### 2. **1INCH (1inch):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** 1INCH is a well-known DeFi token with decent liquidity on major exchanges.
   - **Volatility:** Moderate volatility, which could provide reasonable arbitrage opportunities without excessive risk.
   - **Suitability:** A solid choice if you're looking for a balance between liquidity and volatility.

### 3. **SUSHI (SushiSwap):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** SUSHI is widely traded, particularly on decentralized exchanges, and has strong liquidity.
   - **Volatility:** Similar to 1INCH, SUSHI has moderate volatility, which is conducive to arbitrage.
   - **Suitability:** Another strong contender with good liquidity and moderate volatility.

### 4. **LRC (Loopring):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** LRC is a layer-2 scaling solution token with decent liquidity, though it might not be as widely traded as 1INCH or SUSHI.
   - **Volatility:** Volatility can be moderate to high, depending on market conditions.
   - **Suitability:** Good for arbitrage, but liquidity might be lower than SUSHI or 1INCH.

### 5. **KLAY (Klaytn):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** KLAY is the native token of the Klaytn blockchain, primarily popular in Asia. Liquidity might vary depending on the exchange.
   - **Volatility:** Moderate, with potential for arbitrage opportunities, though it's more regionally focused.
   - **Suitability:** Suitable if trading on exchanges with strong support for Klaytn.

### 6. **RDNT (Radiant):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** RDNT is less well-known, so liquidity might be a concern. It may have lower trading volume compared to others on this list.
   - **Volatility:** Likely high due to its lower market presence, which could be risky.
   - **Suitability:** Less suitable due to potential liquidity issues and high volatility.

### 7. **BSV (Bitcoin SV):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** BSV has decent liquidity on several exchanges but is less popular than BTC or ETH.
   - **Volatility:** Can be volatile, especially during periods of market speculation or controversy.
   - **Suitability:** Suitable if you find good arbitrage opportunities, but be cautious of its controversial status and associated risks.

### 8. **MKR (Maker):**
   - **Liquidity & Volume:** MKR is a well-established DeFi token with strong liquidity and high trading volumes.
   - **Volatility:** Moderate, making it a stable option for arbitrage without excessive risk.
   - **Suitability:** A very solid choice due to its strong liquidity and relatively stable market behavior.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Best Options:** **MKR**, **SUSHI**, and **1INCH** stand out as strong candidates for triangular arbitrage due to their liquidity, moderate volatility, and consistent trading volume.
- **Riskier Options:** **FLOKI** and **RDNT** are more volatile and potentially less liquid, making them riskier choices.
- **Niche Options:** **KLAY** could be a good choice if youâ€™re trading on exchanges that cater to the Asian market, while **BSV** might offer opportunities but comes with its own set of risks.

Ultimately, MKR, SUSHI, or 1INCH would be the most balanced and safer choices for a base coin in triangular arbitrage trading.
